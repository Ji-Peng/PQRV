# PQRV64

## Development board

We use the CanMV-K230 development board based on the [Kendryte K230 SoC]([^1^](https://www.canaan.io/product/k230)). This SoC adopts a big.LITTLE heterogeneous design, and we only use the big core in this work. The big core is based on the [XuanTie C908 processor](https://riscv.org/blog/2022/11/xuantie-c908-high-performance-risc-v-processor-catered-to-aiot-industry-chang-liu-alibaba-cloud/) from [T-Head Semiconductor](https://www.t-head.cn/?lang=en), with the following information:
- Instruction set: RV64GCBV, vector extension version is 1.0
- Frequency: 1.6GHz
- Cache: 32KB L1 instruction/data cache, 256KB L2 cache
- Microarchitecture: Dual-core, 9-stage in-order pipeline
- Memory: 512MB
- Operating system: Linux version 5.10.4
- Compiler: riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc (Xuantie-900 linux-5.10.4 glibc gcc Toolchain V2.8.0 B-20231018) 10.4.0, whose download link is [here](https://occ-oss-prod.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/resource//1698113812618/Xuantie-900-gcc-linux-5.10.4-glibc-x86_64-V2.8.0-20231018.tar.gz).

For the tutorial on how to use this development board, we refer readers to [K230 doc](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/README_en.md) and [K230 sdk](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk). We only emphasize some key configurations here. The command we use to make the system image for the development board is `make CONF=k230_evb_only_linux_defconfig`, which generates Linux OS by BuildRoot for the big core, so that we can run RVV instructions on the big core.

## Regarding more extended instruction sets

The complete instruction set supported by C908 is `-march=rv64imafdcv_zihintpause_zfh_zba_zbb_zbc_zbs_xtheadc -mabi=lp64d`.
We aim to obtain experimental results under `-march=rv64imav` to ensure the highest compatibility.

## Why using the `-static` option?

The current SDK provided by this development board runs Linux (generated by BuildRoot) on the big core, which is a simplified Linux system suitable for embedded scenarios. It does not support a complete set of dynamic libraries. Therefore, under the current configuration, only executable files obtained using the `-static` option can run on the development board. For the sake of fairness in comparison, all experiments involved in this work use the `-static` option.
